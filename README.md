# Decentralized Micro-Grant Funding for Creative Projects (DMCGP) - Initial Repository

## 1. Project Overview

This repository serves as the initial development space for Decentralized Micro-Grant Funding for Creative Projects (DMCGP), a blockchain-based platform designed to revolutionize how creative individuals and small-scale projects access funding.  We aim to create a more transparent, equitable, and community-driven ecosystem by leveraging NFTs, governance tokens, and a novel "Proof-of-Contribution" (PoC) system.

**This repository is currently in the early planning and architectural design phase.**  No functional code exists yet.

## 2. Goals & Vision

*   **Democratize Funding:** Provide a more accessible and inclusive funding option for emerging artists and small creative projects.
*   **Foster Community Engagement:** Empower the creative community to actively participate in funding decisions and support each other.
*   **Promote Transparency & Accountability:** Leverage blockchain technology to ensure a transparent and auditable funding process.
*   **Reward Contribution & Collaboration:** Incentivize community members to contribute their skills and expertise.

## 3. Architectural Overview (Conceptual)

The DMCGP platform will consist of the following key components:

*   **Smart Contracts (Solidity):**  Responsible for managing project proposals (NFTs), governance token distribution, voting logic, and micro-grant disbursement.
*   **Decentralized Storage (IPFS/Arweave):**  Used to store project assets, metadata, and verifiable credentials.
*   **Frontend (React/Vue.js):**  Provides a user-friendly interface for project submission, voting, contribution tracking, and wallet integration.
*   **Verifiable Credentials (VC) System:**  A system for issuing and verifying credentials documenting contributions to projects. We are exploring integration with existing VC standards (W3C).
*   **Governance Token:**  A token that grants voting rights and incentivizes community participation.

## 4. Getting Started (Development Environment Setup)

**This repository is currently in the planning phase.  The following steps outline the intended development environment setup.**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js (version 16 or higher)
    *   npm or yarn package manager
    *   Truffle/Hardhat (for smart contract development)
    *   Ganache or Hardhat Network (local blockchain for testing)
    *   MetaMask or similar wallet extension

2.  **Project Structure (Intended):**
    ```

    ```

3.  **Initial Setup (Future Steps):**
    *   `npm init -y` or `yarn init -y` (to initialize a Node.js project)
    *   Install necessary dependencies (Truffle/Hardhat, web3.js or ethers.js)
    *   Create a basic smart contract structure (e.g., using Truffle Box or Hardhat template)
    *   Set up a local blockchain environment (Ganache or Hardhat Network)

## 5. Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project!  As we are in the early planning stages, initial contributions will likely focus on:

*   **Architecture Design:** Refining the overall system architecture and identifying key design decisions.
*   **Smart Contract Specification:** Detailing the functionality of each smart contract component.
*   **Frontend Mockups:** Creating basic mockups to visualize the user interface.
